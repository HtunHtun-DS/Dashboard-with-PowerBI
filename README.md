# What Does Business Intelligence Mean?

Business Intelligence (often shortened to BI) is a field of expertise that uses data to improve decision-making within organizations. Different tools, such as Power BI, are used to do this.

In practice, it can be used to do things like:

Analyze client behavior to build new offerings. 

Identify key factors that impact production times for a piece in the workshop to gain better understanding and control. 

Calculate the flight risk for top employees with a given salary band or seniority level. 

Measure the impact of projects on the company’s economic performance. 

# The Scope of Your Project With Jane

In summary, Jane has two goals:

To reduce the time it takes to decide whether to approve mortgage applications. 

To improve the quality of approved application files. 

She describes several people who play a role in the decision-making chain for mortgages:

In-branch advisors who do not currently have the necessary decision-making tools, and must rely on their experience.

Branch managers who can confirm or overrule a decision made by the advisors.

The central unit for examining mortgage applications. This unit has the final say but is overwhelmed with requests. 

Jane mentions that the root cause of the delay in decision-making is the amount of information about the borrower that needs to be examined in order to approve or refuse a mortgage:

Professional situation (socio-professional category, employment status, regularity of income, and amount).

Family circumstances (age, number of dependent children).

Down payment amount.

Debt currently held.

Savings capacity (cost of living).
