# What Does Business Intelligence Mean?

Business Intelligence (often shortened to BI) is a field of expertise that uses data to improve decision-making within organizations. Different tools, such as Power BI, are used to do this.

In practice, it can be used to do things like:

Analyze client behavior to build new offerings. 

Identify key factors that impact production times for a piece in the workshop to gain better understanding and control. 

Calculate the flight risk for top employees with a given salary band or seniority level. 

Measure the impact of projects on the company’s economic performance.
